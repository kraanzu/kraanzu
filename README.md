## Who am I? 


I am Murli Tawari, from Kolkata, yet another average 21 y/o guy pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science :) \
I'm currently living at the intersection between the industry and academia.\
I mostly work on making [TUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) with python, hacking on [WMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) and participate in sport programming contests  
Apart from that, I like to play video games and watch anime :D

[Btw, I use Arch](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F6ozib7wpxf651.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=993ebe40082fad7688aab018335c35eb31264f101669a73be3a4b0ef4352cffc&ipo=images)
