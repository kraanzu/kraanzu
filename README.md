## Who am I? 


I am Murli Tawari, from Kolkata, yet another average 21 y/o guy pursuing Computer Science :) \
I'm currently living at the intersection between the industry and academia.\
I mostly work on making [TUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) with python, hacking on [WMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) and participate in sport programming contests  
Apart from that, I like to play video games and watch anime :D

[Btw, I use Arch](https://i.imgur.com/pEibVSn.png)
